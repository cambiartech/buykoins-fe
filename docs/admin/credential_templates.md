## Security Best Practices

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: When sending credentials:

1. **Verify User Identity**: Always confirm you're messaging the correct user
2. **Use Secure Channels**: Only send credentials through the support chat system (not email or external messaging)
3. **Encourage Password Change**: Always remind users to change passwords after setup
4. **Document in Notes**: Record credential details in the onboarding completion notes for audit purposes
5. **Delete After Use**: Consider deleting credential messages after user confirms receipt (if supported)
