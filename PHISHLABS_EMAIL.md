## Email Body:

Dear Phishlabs Security Team,

I am writing to request the retraction of a malicious site report for **buykoins.com** (and associated subdomains: core.buykoins.com, staging.buykoins.com, administrator.buykoins.com), which has been flagged as a phishing/malicious site. This appears to be a false positive.

### Background

Our website, BuyKoins, is a legitimate financial services platform that provides TikTok creators with tools to manage their earnings and facilitate payouts. We are **not** mimicking, impersonating, or attempting to phish TikTok users. Instead, we provide a legitimate service **to** TikTok creators to help them withdraw and manage their earnings from the TikTok Creator Fund.

### Our Legitimate Service

**BuyKoins** operates as follows:

1. **User Onboarding**: TikTok creators sign up on our platform to access payout services
2. **Earnings Management**: We help creators track and manage their TikTok earnings
3. **Payout Processing**: We facilitate secure withdrawals to verified bank accounts
4. **Compliance**: All transactions are logged, users are verified, and we maintain strict KYC/AML procedures

We are a registered financial services provider and operate transparently with full user consent. Our platform includes:
- Clear terms of service
- Privacy policy
- Contact information and support channels
- Secure authentication and data encryption
- Transparent fee structures

### Why This Is a False Positive

1. **No Impersonation**: We do not claim to be TikTok or use TikTok branding in a misleading way
2. **Clear Service Offering**: Our landing page and documentation clearly state we are a third-party service provider
3. **Legitimate Business Model**: We charge transparent fees for facilitating payouts - similar to PayPal, Stripe, or other payment processors
4. **User Consent**: All users explicitly sign up for our service and authorize us to help manage their earnings
5. **No Credential Harvesting**: We do not ask users for their TikTok passwords or attempt to access their accounts without permission

### Impact

Due to this false positive report, Netlify (our hosting provider, case #509455) has password-protected our website, preventing legitimate users from accessing our services. This is causing significant business disruption and harm to TikTok creators who rely on our platform for their income.

### Request

I respectfully request that Phishlabs:

1. **Review our website** at buykoins.com and associated subdomains
2. **Retract the malicious site report** as it is a false positive
3. **Whitelist our domain** to prevent future false positives
4. **Provide written confirmation** to Netlify that our site is legitimate so they can remove the password protection

### Supporting Information

- **Business Contact:** [Your Business Email]

- **Company Registration:** [If applicable, include business registration details]
- **Netlify Case:** #509455

We are happy to provide any additional documentation, verification, or information needed to demonstrate the legitimacy of our business.

### Urgency

This issue is currently preventing our users (TikTok creators) from accessing their earned income. We would greatly appreciate a prompt review and resolution.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your response and the retraction of this false positive report.

Best regards,
